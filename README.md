GifTastic utilizes the APIs from giphy.com to extract 10 random giphys on the topic that the user clicks.

User also can enter his/her topic in the input field.  Press Submit will create a button with the user's topic.  Which adds to the list of already available buttons.  When the newly created button is clicked, 10 giphys of the related topics will show up.

Give it a try!  If you have any questions, please contact Catherine Chan @ learnafew@gmail.com.
